# OSN-P
Solutions for OSN-P problems (Provincial-level selection for the Indonesian National Olympiad in Informatics).

The problems can be accessed [here](https://tlx.toki.id/problems/problemsets?archive=osp)

My solutions are organized using the format `[year]/[problem]`. For example, my solution to the 2022 OSN-P problem "B5. Melompati Lapangan" is located at `/2022/B5.cpp`. 

This repository was made for a GitHub Software Engineering assignment.
